The planned topics for each week are here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10eiRdfVfPTmtPPCpNfP9WqBM-Wdjg3XjRkx_iP0v-48/edit?usp=sharing

Old repo: https://github.com/Joseph-Rance/Computing-Soc-old

**06/02/2021:** I've put some files from the old Com Soc repo in the `2020-2021` folder which be used as references for future presentations. I also added a list of everything we have done over the last year as some ideas for future meetings. Since the Robotic arm project will continue to run independently of Com Soc, it will stay in a separate repo: https://github.com/Joseph-Rance/Com-Soc-robotic-arm.
