        "Recently home from his shopping trip, Pratykash is now hungry. He has a large library of recipies, but doesn't know what to cook. He needs you help to pick what to make.\n",
        "\n",
        "The task is to create a search engine that helps Pratyaksh decide what he wants to make. How the search engine works is up to you, but it should return a list of dishes ranked in order from most relevant to least relevant. You can determine relevance from whichever factors you want (e.g. keywords, ingredients, or similar dishes that Pratykash has already had).\n",
        "\n",
        "Becuase we only have one hour, you won't be judged on the interface, so a plain python interface is fine (i.e. you can get the information about what Pratyaksh is searching for through normal python inputs).\n",
        "\n",
        "You will be scored on 4 main criteria:\n",
        "1. How intuitive is the search tool to use?\n",
        "2. How accurate are the results it returns (e.g. if it has an option for food country of origin, is the food returned from that country)?\n",
        "3. How \"intelligent\" is the search algorithm (an intelligent algorithm may take into account many factors such as food popularity and similarity to dishes Pratyaksh has already had, rather than just one or two)\n",
        "4. How original the idea is\n",
        "\n",
        "We will present our solutions next week, and the winner will be decided by vote\n",
